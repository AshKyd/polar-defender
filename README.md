Defend the solar system from an alien invasion on this modern twist on space
invaders.

With two game modes four levels and a bunch of aliens to destroy, there's plenty
of fun in this messy space shoot-em-up.

An entry for js13kgames. I've wanted to do something with polar coordinates since working on the [ABC 2013-14 ashes catches game](http://www.abc.net.au/news/sport/cricket/ashes-2013-game/), so here's a little radial shooter for a bit of fun.

### Building

- `npm run build` builds everything into dist/

## Platform support

The game has been tested and made to work on the major browsers.

| Browser            | Support | Mobile |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Chrome             | A+      | Yes    |
| Firefox            | A+      | Yes    |
| Safari             | B       | Yes    |
| Android Browser 4+ | B+      | Yes    |
| Internet Explorer  | F       | No     |

There have been reports IE just displays a blank screen, but I haven't got a
Windows machine or the time to debug it. The game should (eventually) work on
IE 9+.

Safari on iOS is kinda slow. It's playable but visibly choppy. I'm not sure if
it's slower hardware, browser or both.

## js13k

The #js13k build is in a separate "js13k" branch, and includes some last-minute
optimisations to bring it under the required filesize. The branch is provided
as a reference only and is out of sync with master.
